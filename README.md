<h2 id="project">📁 Projeto</h2>
<p>This is a personal project that I really enjoyed, both the result and the experience generated with it.</p>
<p>Tmovies is a website where you have access to different films and series, films that are about to be released, that have been released recently and those that already exist on the platforms. You have them all on this site!</p>
<p>There is the Home section with the top movies and series, a page for films and others for series.</p>
<p>There is a lot to add to this project, such as a session for saving films and series that you have marked with a star, a login session, it is much more.</p>
<p>This is a project with many possibilities for improvement and growth. The project is undergoing improvements, it is not yet 100% finished.</p>
